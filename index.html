    <p><em>Research Assistant at <strong> <a href="https://www.macdonaldlab.ca/">the Maclab</a></strong> | <strong>UofT </strong> BSc Psych. and Nutr. Sci. Undergrad., 4th Year</em></p>
    <p>Hello! I'm Vikki, a Psyc and Nutr. Sci. undergraduate at UofT, and a research assistant to The MacDonald Lab and</p>
    <p>to The International Partnership for Queer Youth Resilience. My main areas of research interest revolve around</p>
    <p>romantic relationships and well being.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In the future I hope to become a psychotherapist for couples by facilitating healthy communication and mindset,</p>
    <p>until then I will continue to seek out new knowledge and ask questions about the research done in romantic</p>
    <p>relations, hoping to acquire new perspectives and lens‚Äô for critically thinking about romantic relationships. </p>
    <br>
    <p>As I continue to strengthen my interpersonal skills and gain new insight into the field of psychology, I seek to work</p>
    <p>with a team aiming to facilitate a client centred approach by investigating (a) particular dimension(s) of well being</p>
    <p>within relationships (more broadly speaking, are investigating norms of positive psychology). If you would like to</p>
    <p>learn more, message me here, or email me at vikki.pham@mail.utoronto.ca,</p>
